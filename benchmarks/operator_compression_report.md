## Summary

State-only streaming preserves recurrent `h_prev` while dropping historical KV tensors. This is compressed memory, not lossless transcript recall.

## Scale-Gate Diagnostics

| Steps | Gate mean | Active ratio | Nonzero ratio | Sparse selected ratio | Per-scale means |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 100 | 0.881 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | s0_mean=0.881, s1_mean=0.881, s2_mean=0.881, s3_mean=0.881, s4_mean=0.881 |
| 1000 | 0.881 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | s0_mean=0.881, s1_mean=0.881, s2_mean=0.881, s3_mean=0.881, s4_mean=0.881 |

## Caveats

- KV streaming remains the exact incremental path; its divergence from the full-sequence oracle should stay near numerical noise.
- State-only streaming is intentionally lossy relative to full attention because it keeps only recurrent state.
- Current scale-gate masking affects the blend weights and diagnostics. It is not yet a custom sparse kernel that avoids the upstream resonance matrix multiply.
- Optional `--sparse_resonance_kernel` skips inactive tau-scale projection/scan work, but top-k scale selection is chunk-dependent and can change KV parity relative to dense full-sequence execution.
- Claims in external material should report measured cache size and latency separately from future compute-skipping hypotheses.
