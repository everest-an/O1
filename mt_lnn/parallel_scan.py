"""
parallel_scan.py — Blelloch parallel prefix scan for linear recurrences.

Solves h_t = A_t * h_{t-1} + X_t,  h_0 = 0,  for t = 0 ... T-1
in O(log T) sequential depth (O(T log T) total work) instead of O(T)
sequential time.

This is the same scan algorithm used by Mamba / S4 / S5 for selective SSM
training. It is what makes MT-LNN's "liquid" recurrence actually recurrent
during training — without this, training reduces to a gated FFN.

Implementation
--------------
Recursive form of François Fleuret's pscan, with multi-dim batching:
    https://fleuret.org/dlc/materials/pscan.py

A trivially-batched PyTorch port also appears in:
    https://github.com/alxndrTL/mamba.py/blob/main/mambapy/pscan.py
    (MIT licence, attribution preserved)
    https://github.com/sustcsonglin/mamba-triton  (Triton variant)

Both A and X are batched over any number of leading dims; the *last* dim of A
and the *second-to-last* dim of X are the scan dimension T. This matches the
shape we already pass through the model: (..., T) for the recurrence
multiplier and (..., T, D) for the inputs.

Correctness is checked in tests/test_parallel_scan.py against a sequential
reference implementation.
